	The log file generated by the <em>CM Engine</em> contains all of the quantitative information from an experiment. The data are organized by plate names, which identify the queries, plate numbers and conditions from each experiment. This organization is required for proper processing by <em>DR</em> and <em>SV Engines</em>. <em>CM Engine</em> automatically formats log files appropriately. However, data from other sources can be formatted for use with <em>DR</em> and <em>SV Engines</em>. <br/>
	In addition to what is presented here, further details / clarification  may be gleamed by reviewing the documentation packaged with the <em>CM Engine</em>,  <a href='http://cm-engine.sourceforge.net' class="ext_link" title="SourceForge" >available here.</a><br/><br/>
	<u>The rules for the log file format are as follows:</u>
	</div>
	<ul>
		<li>Log files must be in plain text (“.txt” file extension).</li>
		<li>The first line of a log file is a plate identifier, which must conform to a specific convention - query,plateNumber,condition. The next lines of the log file are the quantitative data for every position on that plate in column order (from left to right) using a separate line for each value. Data for additional plates follow on successive lines using this same format.</li>
		<li><b>Plate Identifier Guidelines</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Plate identifiers should be in the format: query,plateNumber,condition.
					<ul>
						<li>Query: common identifier for all plates within one set. For example, if the plates in a set were control plates, then Query could be named “Control”.</li>
						<li>plateNumber: A unique identifier used to identify the plates in the log file. Integer values are recommended to facilitate proper data sorting within the DR Engine. Note that plateNumbers in a log file and a key file must match.</li>
						<li>Condition: descriptor for any additional treatment of the plate (e.g., drug or inducer).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>You must identify at least one query as a comparer. You may designate the comparer in the "Comparer Query" field of the <em>"ScreenMill - Data Review Engine"</em> web page.</li>
				<li>All plates of a given main condition will be compared to all plates with the main condition that is identified as the control, provided that the plate IDs match.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Plates do not need to be listed in the log file in any particular order.</li>
		<li>Only 96, 384 and 1536 array formats are accepted.</li>
		<li>The array format in a log file should be homogeneous (only 96 or only 384 or only 1536 array format).</li>
		<li>Blank positions in a plate should be listed in the log file as ‘0’.</li>
		<li>The number of lines in a log file should be equal to: number of plates in the log file + (number of plates in the log file x the array format).
			<ul>
				<li>For example, if your log file contained data for 5 plates in a 384 array format, it should contain 1925 lines ( 5 + [5 x 384] ).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Example Plate Identifiers:
		<ul>
			<li>Cln3,4,Cu.tif ← This is an example plate ID typical for a SDL screen. It identifies "Cln3" as the query in plate 4, and that a condition, copper (Cu), is present in the plate (the Rothstein lab uses copper to induce gene expression when conducting SDL screens).</li>
			<li>Control,plate1,.tif  ←  In this example a generic label of “Control” has been entered as the query. This plate contains data from plate 1 and no condition is present.</li>
			<li>glucose,1,.tif  ←  In this example "glucose" is the query in plate 1 with no condition.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Example Log File
		<ul>
			<li>You may download the following log file to get a better understanding of the required format</li>
			<li>This file contains data for an SDL screen in which 3 genes labeled "Exp", "Exp2", and "Exp3" were over-expressed in the yeast deletion library.</li>
			<li>The query "Control" is used to indicate control plates.</li>
			<li>Some of the plates identifiers have 'Cu' listed as a condition. Copper (Cu) was used to induce expression of "Exp", "Exp2", and "Exp3".</li>
